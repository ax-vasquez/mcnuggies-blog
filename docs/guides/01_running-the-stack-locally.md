# Running the stack locally

## Front end

The front end can be run independently of the back end. Simply run `yarn web` from the root.
* Without starting the `mailer` package, the Contact form will not work

## Packages

Packages _should_ all be started with the `yarn dev` command. However, newly-added packages will need to be added to the gulp setup.
