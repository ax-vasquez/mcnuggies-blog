## Monorepo structure

This repository uses a monorepo structure in anticipation that this "chunky starter", as I'm calling it for now, will grow in terms of feature sets and applications.

### Packages
1. `mailer` - simple node mailer server
2. `next` - "front end" web application
3. `studio` - Sanity studio (where the schema is defined and its types are generated from)
